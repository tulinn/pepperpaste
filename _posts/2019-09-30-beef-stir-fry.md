    1. Prepare sauce by adding all the sauce ingredients to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Set aside.
    2. Heat a large rimmed skillet (I prefer this cast-iron skillet) over medium heat and cook the steak until just tender. Set aside.
    3. Heat a separate large rimmed skillet (or pot) over medium heat. Once hot, add sesame oil (or water) and all the other vegetables. Stir to combine and saut√© until just tender.
    4. Add the steak and the sauce, increase the heat to medium-high heat, and cook until well combined and the mixture is very hot - about 5 minutes.
    5. Serve with white rice and fresh parsley.
